    "The objective of this project is to use the Python package nltk (widely used for natural language processing) to cluster the courses offered during Fall 2023 at Amherst College based on their description (usually ~2 paragraphs). The idea is to analyze what classes are clustered together by the model and compare how they align with their respective department.\n",

    "Moreover, it would be interesting to analyze whether there are some outliers when visualizing these clusters, and if so, why is that happening? Can future courses from incoming professors \"diversify\" our current catalogue?\n",

In the first half of the semester we ground our understanding of the STEM experience at Amherst in national and global contexts, specifically looking at the way in which gender, class, race, sexuality, and geographic upbringing might shape these experiences. We accomplish this through reading interdisciplinary scholarly literature and surveying existing evidence-based inclusive practices at a range of educational institutions. We will supplement this research with interviews with current and past members of the Amherst STEM community. In the second half of the semester, students will design their own group projects that apply the findings of their research to develop resources and engage the STEM community, whether at the college, local, or national level.  Course work includes weekly readings, reflective writing, in-class discussion, and will culminate in a public presentation on the group projects.\"]\n",

How efficient is my approach to solving a problem? How does human-readable code get translated into something that can run on physical hardware? What problems are even solvable by computers? In order to study such questions, computer scientists must be able to communicate with one another using a common language, express ideas formally and precisely, and reason logically about these ideas. This course will introduce mathematics as the primary analytical tool used by computer scientists. Topics may include but are not limited to set notation, symbolic logic, proof techniques such as induction and contradiction, and applications of these topics in computer science. Much more important than any individual topic, however, is the experience that students will gain with formal reasoning.\"]\n",

We will prove Arrow’s Theorem and discuss its implications. After exploring the pitfalls of various voting systems through both theoretical analysis and case studies, we will try to answer some pressing questions: Which voting system best reflects the will of the voters? Which is least susceptible to manipulation? What properties should we seek in a voting system, and how can we best attain them?\"]\n",
